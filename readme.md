# City Builder Playground

This is going to be a bigger undertaking than my previous project [Rogue Like Playground](https://github.com/john0shaw/rogue-like-playground).  It will be a fairly barebones game in the style of a city builder / rts / colony game.

It will remain open source under the MIT License, and I will try to keep it updated frequently so that I can see changes in how I structure things / develop the game.
