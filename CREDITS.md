I'm going to make it a practice to include links to all of the items included in this project (and future projects) by starting with an acknowledgements document early.  Hopefully this will let me track items used in this project and ensure that anyone knows where to find the items or authors.  Some items seen in the game may be modified or altered to suit my specific needs.
